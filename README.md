# Data Science Assistant

Welcome to the Data Science Assistant, an all-in-one Streamlit application designed to streamline your data science workflow. This tool offers functionalities for data ingestion, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, modeling, visualization, and even includes a chatbot to answer your data science queries.

## Features

- **Dataset Understanding**: Gain insights into the structure and composition of your dataset.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, encode categorical variables, handle outliers, and scale/normalize your data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform summary statistics, correlation analysis, pairplots, and heatmaps.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features, perform feature selection, generate polynomial and interaction features.
- **Modeling**: Train machine learning models with options for hyperparameter tuning and save/load trained models.
- **Visualization**: Generate various visualizations using Plotly, Altair, and Seaborn.
- **Chat with Bot**: Interact with a chatbot to get answers to your data science questions.

4. Run the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

### Dataset Understanding

Upload your dataset and explore its structure, columns, missing values, and duplicate rows.

### Data Cleaning

Handle missing values, remove duplicates, encode categorical variables, handle outliers, and scale/normalize your data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform summary statistics, correlation matrix analysis, pairplots, and heatmaps to understand your data better.

### Feature Engineering

Create new features, perform feature selection, generate polynomial features, and create interaction features.

### Visualization

Generate visualizations using Plotly, Altair, and Seaborn for various chart types including bar charts, scatter plots, line charts, histograms, box plots, heatmaps, pie charts, and violin plots.

### Modeling

Train machine learning models with options for hyperparameter tuning. Save and load trained models for future use.

### Chat with Bot

Interact with a chatbot to get answers to your data science questions and guidance on various tasks.
